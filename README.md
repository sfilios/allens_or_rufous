# allens_or_rufous

This project is based on the Fast.ai assignment to create an image classifier using data that I gathered. I chose to build a classifier to discriminate Rufous and Allens Hummingbirds, two species that are notoriously difficult to tell apart. Humans are usually unable to do this task without looking at the spread of the tail of a hummingbird, and I was curious to see if a neural network could perform better.

I also intend to use this project to test what kind of datasets are best to use for recognition tasks. First, I will deploy a model that uses images gathered from Google Images. Then, I will use a curated dataset from the Macaulay Library. I intend to test each of these models against the other dataset to see how they perform.
